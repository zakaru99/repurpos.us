    <p>
      To ensure a successful and efficient screen, please review the entire process. 
      Standardized, linear-staged workflows and automation allow us to work with many partners at once. 
      While we can sometimes accommodate alternative workflows, it is important to finalize everything before screening begins.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h4>Before Screening Begins</h4>
  <div class="workflow-card">
    <ol>
      <li>Send an email to <a href="mailto:reframescreens@scripps.edu">reframescreens@scripps.edu</a> with the <a href="../../assets/workflow/0_New Assay Proposal.docx">Assay Proposal</a> form filled out for your assay</li>
      <li>MTA template provided by Calibr for signature at both institutions</li>
      <li>Final <a href="../../assets/workflow/1_AssayRegistration.Description new 1.docx" download>Assay Description</a> form delivered to Calibr <a href="mailto:reframescreens@scripps.edu">reframescreens@scripps.edu</a> pre-screen meeting scheduled</li>
      <li>By default, partner agrees to a standard primary screen (singlicate) and two dose response sets for initial follow-up on.  
        <br><small>Dose sets are provided as replicate plates. Plates are prepared as 8-point 1:3 serial dilutions, starting at 10 μM unless otherwise discussed. Exceptions must be approved by the ReFRAME committee. For these, the partner must complete the <a href="../../assets/workflow/supplemental_QuantityException.docx" download>Quantity Exception</a> form. More information on standard usage can be found <a href="../../assets/workflow/0_Can_I_use_Reframe.docx" download>here</a>.</small>
      </li>
      <li>Optional: Partner sends Calibr controls dissolved in DMSO. Active concentration adjusted to match volume of the screening compounds whenever possible. On average, 100uL of 10mM stock is sufficient.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <h4>Screening Round 1</h4>
  <div class="workflow-card">
    <ol>
      <li>Calibr sends partner <a href="../../assets/workflow/1_Regarding Pre-spotted Plates.docx" download>pre-spotted plates</a> and compound keys (as blinded CBR IDs) for primary screen.</li>
      <li>Partner performs screen and selects hits (up to 1% of the library)</li>
      <li>Partner sends hitlist as CBR IDs using the <a href="../../assets/workflow/2_PrimaryDataTemplate 3.xlsx" download>Primary Data</a> form</li>
      <li>Calibr sends partner two sets of pre-spotted dose response plates. One set can be used for a counter screen upon submission of an additional assay description form for the counter screen.</li>
      <li>Collaborator sends Calibr dose response data via <a href="../../assets/workflow/3_DoseResponseData.xlsx" download>Dose Response Data</a> form</li>
      <li>Calibr sends collaborator structure and identities of confirmed hits</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <h4>Additional Counter Screens (On ReFRAME committee approval)</h4>
  <div class="workflow-card">
    <ol>
      <li>In some cases, additional material for counter screen assays can be provided by Calibr.  
        <br><small>Requests for additional material or other resources will be reviewed by the ReFRAME committee. Partners are asked to complete Screening Round 1 before additional requests for compounds.</small>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <h4>Post Screening Begins</h4>
  <div class="workflow-card">
    <ol>
      <li>Dose response data uploaded to ReFRAMEdb.org by Calibr 1 year after partner receives structure identities.  
        <br><small>Partner can contact Calibr to request a delay under some circumstances.</small>
      </li>
      <li>Public success is the best way for our partners to support the ReFRAME project.  
        <br><small>Please notify Calibr of any publications, grants or studies that resulted from the ReFRAME screen using the <a href="../../assets/workflow/3_Milestone_Check_In.docx" download>Milestone</a> document.</small>
      </li>
    </ol>
