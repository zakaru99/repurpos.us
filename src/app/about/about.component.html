        <p class="about-p">
          The chemical diversity and known safety profiles of drugs already tested in humans makes them a valuable set of compounds to explore potential therapeutic utility in indications outside those originally targeted. This practice of “drug
          repurposing” has become commonplace in academic and other non-profit drug discovery efforts, with the appeal that significantly less time and resources are required to advance a candidate into the clinic. This is especially the case in phenotypic and other
          cell-based screens in which this collection is being screened against a large number of known and novel targets in parallel.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here we report a comprehensive open-access, drug repositioning screening set of 13,288 compounds (termed ReFRAME) that was assembled by combining three widely-used commercial drug competitive intelligence databases (Clarivate Integrity, GVK Excelra GoStar, and Citeline Pharmaprojects), together with extensive patent mining of small molecules that have been dosed in humans. To date ~13,288 compounds (~80% of compounds identified from data mining) have been purchased or synthesized, and subsequently plated for screening.
